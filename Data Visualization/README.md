# Data Visualization
Data visualization is an essential part of data analysis and machine learning, and Python provides a wide range of libraries to create stunning visualizations. Here's an overview of data visualization in Python, including popular libraries, types of plots, and examples.  

### Popular libraries for data visualization in Python:
1. Matplotlib: A low-level library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
2. Seaborn: A high-level library built on top of Matplotlib, providing a more visually appealing and statistical style.
3. Plotly: A library for creating interactive, web-based visualizations.
4. Bokeh: A library for creating interactive, web-based visualizations, with a focus on large datasets.
5. ggplot: A Python implementation of the popular R library, ggplot2, for creating static visualizations.

### Types of plots and their uses:
1. Line plots: Used to display trends over time or other continuous variables.
2. Bar plots: Used to compare categorical data or discrete values.
3. Scatter plots: Used to display the relationship between two continuous variables.
4. Histograms: Used to display the distribution of a single continuous variable.
5. Box plots: Used to display the distribution of a single continuous variable, including outliers.
6. Heatmaps: Used to display the relationship between two continuous variables, with color representing the magnitude of the relationship.
