# ITERATORS and ITERABLES
# ITERATOR - is an object that implements the iterator protocol, 
#             which consists of the methods __iter__() and __next__().
# ITERABLE - is any object that can return its members one at a time, 
#            allowing it to be iterated over in a loop. Examples of iterables include 
#            lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and strings.
