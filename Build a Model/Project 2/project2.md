Here's a complete project outline where we can practice building models in Python, covering data preprocessing, model building, tuning, and evaluation.  
We'll use a well-known dataset from scikit-learn to simplify data access. Here's how we'll structure it:

## Project 2: Building a Machine Learning Model (Classification)

#### Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset
This dataset contains features computed from breast cancer histopathological images. The objective is to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on the provided features.

#### Dataset Overview:
* Number of Samples: 569
* Number of Features: 30 (such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness of the cell nuclei)
* Target: Binary classification (0 for benign, 1 for malignant)

#### Tasks to Achieve:
1. Data Exploration & Preprocessing
* Task 1: Load the dataset and understand its structure (shape, features, target variable). 
* Task 2: Check for missing values and handle them (if any). 
* Task 3: Visualize data using correlation matrices, histograms, box plots, etc.
* Task 4: Encode the target variable (if needed). 
* Task 5: Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).
* Task 6: Normalize or scale features to ensure consistent input for machine learning models.

2. Model Selection & Training
* Task 7: Train the following classifiers on the dataset:
  * Logistic Regression
  * Random Forest
  * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  * Gradient Boosting Classifier
* Task 8: Use cross-validation (e.g., KFold or StratifiedKFold) to ensure model generalization.

3. Model Evaluation
* Task 9: Evaluate the models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve.
* Task 10: Perform confusion matrix analysis to understand the performance of each model.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning  
* Task 11: Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters for one of the models (e.g., Random Forest or SVM).

5. Feature Importance & Selection  
* Task 12: Analyze feature importance using methods like feature coefficients (for Logistic Regression), feature importance (for Random Forest), or SHAP values.
* Task 13: Use a feature selection technique (like Recursive Feature Elimination) and check if the performance improves by selecting fewer features.

6. Model Deployment (Optional)
* Task 14: Save the final model using joblib or pickle and demonstrate loading it to make predictions on new data.
