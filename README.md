# Welcome to my Data Science journey !
This repository serves as a storage place for my data science findings, learnings, and experiments. As I embark on this journey to learn data science, I want to document my progress, share my insights, and reflect on my experiences.  

# What to Expect
In this repository, you'll find a collection of notes, code snippets, and projects related to data science. I'll be covering various topics, including:       

* Data preprocessing and visualization.
*  Machine learning algorithms and techniques.
* Statistical modeling and inference.
* Data wrangling and manipulation.
* And more !.

# Goals
My goal is to learn and improve my skills in data science, and to share my knowledge with others. I hope that this repository will serve as a resource for those who are also learning data science, and that we can learn together.
# Let's Learn Together!
I'm excited to start this journey and share my learnings with you. Feel free to explore this repository, ask questions, and contribute to the discussions. Let's learn data science together!
